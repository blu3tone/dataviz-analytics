After cloning the repository: 

1. Download the meraki log files you want to analyze to the meraki/data directory.  For example 
the files at: 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jSxlkQ37FtAx0YMwqjOn8yXWH6ECPwQ-

which are too big for GitHub.

2. Edit the list of files at around line 320 of logreader.py to match. The files must be listed in reverse time order 
(i.e from newest to oldest)

3. From the command line execute:
    python logreader.py
